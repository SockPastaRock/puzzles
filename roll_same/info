How many rolls on average to get N dice to all show the same value?

So for example:

if N=3
 roll and get -> 1,2,3
 re-roll the 2 and 3 -> 1,4,4
 re-roll the 1 -> 2,4,4
 re-roll the 2 -> 4,4,4
In this case, it took 4 rolls for N=3 but what is the average number of rolls for N?

Note that this question is a little trickier than it seems.
